## Today's Talk

-   (Re) Introducing Stephen Thompson
-   Work to date - serious games to study key hole surgery.
-   Opportunities to participate:
    -   A literature review on game development in research.
    -   Upcoming project - Exergaming: a serious game for dizziness disorder rehabilitation [#1137](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/arc-opportunities-tracker/issues/1137 "Exergaming on ARC Opportunity Tracker").

## Introducing Stephen

-   Senior Research Software Engineer Since October 2023

-   Background in augmented reality for keyhole surgery.

-   informus, education, EMAP, sense-base.

## Human Interest 1 - My Summer 👎

-   Usual summer; camping and water sports.

<!-- -->

-   This summer: 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 🏥🦴🧑‍🔧🚗 = less camping less water.

## Human Interest 2 - My Summer 👍

-   Seals

## Human Interest 2.1 - My Summer 👍

-   More time for [Cricket.](https://cwc.play-cricket.com/website/results/6805674 "My Cricket results on Play Cricket.")

## Games for Teaching and Research

-   Research: how people learn to collaborate with intelligent machines.
-   Simple tools: 🔪🔨 fairly easy to predict how they will be used.
-   Intelligent tools 🤖 💻 ❓
-   We can learn to collaborate with games.

## SciKit-Surgery F.R.E.D.

![](images/fitzpatrick.png "alt-fig="Image of 2009 conference paper by Fitzpatrick titled Fiducial registration error and target registration error are uncorrelated.""){width="640"}

-   2019 - [SciKit-Surgery F.R.E.D.](https://scikit-surgeryfred.ew.r.appspot.com/ "Scikit-Surgery FRED, web applicatin for teaching point based registration.")
-   Developing an effective method to teach the statistics of point (fiducual) based registration (during covid lockdown).
-   Uses a game for formative assessment.

-  JavaScript, game assets, scenes, physics etc.

-  [Self Citation - added a citation.cff to repository.](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/commit/32c82ef7283feb85eff71ab4f5298ff17fd8e3c4 "Citing myself by contributing a citation.cff to an existing project.")

## Distraction Results

-   Generally similar to past games but inconclusive.
-   Difficult to recruit surgeons.
-   Opensource analysis tools - [streamlit](https://vessel-game-user.streamlit.app/ "The analysis tools hosted on streamlit")

## Distraction Results

![](images/distraction_results.png){height="100%" fig-alt="Screenshot of qualitative analsis results hosted on streamlit."}

## Summary of work to date

-   Serious games can be used to create publishable data for surgical applications.
-   Serious games make a fun and achievable MSc project.
-   Recruiting sufficient surgeons is the main challenge.

[Summary in ARC Blog.](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/using-serious-games-for-research-in-keyhole-surgery/%22 "A summary of serious games for keyhole surgery on ARC's blog.")

## Game Engines in Research

-   Longer term: Build ARC knowledge base so we can deliver games for research effectively.
-   Short term: What game engines feature in research outputs (publications)?
-   Task: perform a systematic literature review of game engines use.

## [Game Engine Literature Review](https://github-pages.arc.ucl.ac.uk/game_engines_for_research/ "An open source literature review hosted on github.")

```

## Get involved.

-   Read some papers, submit reviews.
-   Improve website design.
-   Implement searches of other databases.
-   Aiming for a publication sometime in 2026.

## Upcoming gaming projects.

-   October 2025 - Exergaming: a serious game for dizziness disorder rehabilitation [#1137](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/arc-opportunities-tracker/issues/1137 "Exergaming on ARC Opportunity Tracker").
-   A series of minigames using a Tobii eye tracker to aid peadiatric treatment.
-   Hardware interface / game design. 50% FTE for 12 months.
